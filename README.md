# times-rolled-for-snake-eyes

My solution for Chapter 3 Exercise 1 of "Introduction to Programming Using Java"

Problem Description:
How many times do you have to roll a pair of dice before they come up snake eyes? You
could do the experiment by rolling the dice by hand. Write a computer program that
simulates the experiment. The program should report the number of rolls that it makes
before the dice come up snake eyes. (Note: “Snake eyes” means that both dice show a
value of 1.) Exercise 2.2 explained how to simulate rolling a pair of dice.
